    "clue": "Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for routing packets between networks?",
    "options": [
      "Layer 1 - Physical",
      "Layer 2 - Data Link",
      "Layer 3 - Network",
      "Layer 4 - Transport"
    ],
    "answer": "Layer 3 - Network",
    "explanation": "The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and determining the best path for data to travel between source and destination networks, which is the definition of routing."

    "options": [
      "Session Layer",
      "Transport Layer",
      "Network Layer",
      "Presentation Layer"
    ],
    "answer": "Transport Layer",
    "explanation": "The Transport Layer (Layer 4) ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications. TCP is a classic Layer 4 protocol that provides these services."

    "clue": "The process of adding headers to data at each layer of the OSI model is known as ________.",
    "answer": "encapsulation",
    "explanation": "Encapsulation is the process where protocol information is added to the data at each layer. The data package is then passed down to the next lower layer."
